# Changelog

## 4.8.0 — 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Hold startup cards, shelves, and promo renderers behind a layout-preserving pre-paint gate until settings, watched history, and the first classification finish; fail open after three seconds if initialization stalls.
- Classify continuation batches plus relevant progress-width, title, link, badge, and text hydration in the mutation's observer turn.
- Re-evaluate virtualized/recycled renderers when their video URL changes, and never cache incomplete shells before identity, title, or channel metadata arrives.
- Repair managed filter classes stripped by YouTube and release route/settings-scoped reasons immediately when their filter is disabled.
- Keep detached internal card mutations on the incremental path instead of scheduling a redundant full-document pass.
- Hide late promo, news, and Shorts-shelf insertions before their debounced legacy maintenance pass can paint.
- Remove the prior 40-selector relational anti-flash stylesheet and permanent keep markers during same-DOM extension updates.
- Restore DeArrow titles and thumbnails when DeArrow or the YouTube master switch is disabled, and bind originals/replacements to the current video so recycled cards cannot restore or retain another video's metadata.
- Preserve dirty watched-history batches after failed writes while a failed initial read stays read-only.
- Make clear generation-tagged, mutation-barrier protected, and distributed across tabs; current-generation state repairs any older fixed-key write that lands afterward.
- Make watched and channel-hidden Undo operations deterministic across tabs, including against stale whole-shard snapshots.
- Re-read invalidated startup snapshots without consuming the storage-failure budget, retry transient startup failures with backoff, repair stale persisted counts, and prevent delayed loaders from publishing across a local clear.
- Complete the v2-to-v3 migration from the monolithic watched-operation record to sharded records, including records received from an older live tab.
- Keep distributed-clear notifications behind a mutation barrier so synchronous rescans cannot repopulate the history being cleared.
- Invalidate SponsorBlock badge results when categories change, remove badges from recycled cards immediately, and preserve the six-request cap across category generations.
- Report clear failures in the options page while retaining the existing durable history.

### Performance

- Replace the 200 ms whole-document mutation reaction with a synchronous dirty-card pass driven by MutationObserver records.
- Keep high-frequency style/text/thumbnail observation scoped to known cards and comments, and ignore unrelated style/class churn.
- Canonicalize nested YouTube renderers to one outer card and deduplicate every mutation batch.
- Search only newly inserted subtrees for legacy shelf/promo renderers instead of rescanning an existing large grid for every mutation record.
- Replace the 2-second recovery loop and 1.5-second global progress scan with event-driven filtering plus a 10-second safety pass.
- Stop physically moving Polymer grid nodes; CSS display-contents layout reflows rows while filtered nodes remain hidden in place.
- Use a true trailing debounce for unrelated page/player work.
- Persist and drain SponsorBlock/DeArrow card queues with at most six concurrent requests per service, including initial and duplicate cards.
- Batch watched-history writes after a scan goes quiet, with a 10-second maximum wait and a background/page-hide flush.
- Shard watched Undo operations alongside watched IDs so one remove/restore does not rewrite the complete operation history.
- Stop YouTube observers, queues, and recurring timers when a newer content-script instance takes over.

### Validation

- Add 35 dependency-free Node regressions covering a 600-card channel, incremental appends, bounded shelf scanning, hydration, incomplete/recycled renderers, DeArrow identity, filter precedence and route release, redundant-scan suppression, storage sharding/retry and autonomous read recovery, simultaneous tabs, distributed clear/re-entry, loader races and churn, stale-generation repair, metadata repair, load-time/live operation migration, Undo convergence, and Chromium MAIN-world player/idle bridge fallbacks.
